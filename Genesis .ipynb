And the Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters.And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.And God said, Let there be a firmament in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth: and it was so.And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.And the evening and the morning were the third day.And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light on the earth: and it was so.And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light on the earth,And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that has life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.And God created great whales, and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creeps on the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creeps on the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.

And the fourth river is Euphrates.And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat:But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it: for in the day that you eat thereof you shall surely die.And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them: and whatever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her to the man.And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall join to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.\".lower()"

Have you eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded you that you should not eat?And the man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.And the LORD God said to the woman, What is this that you have done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.And the LORD God said to the serpent, Because you have done this, you are cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; on your belly shall you go, and dust shall you eat all the days of your life:And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; in sorrow you shall bring forth children; and your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you.And to Adam he said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it: cursed is the ground for your sake; in sorrow shall you eat of it all the days of your life;Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to you; and you shall eat the herb of the field;In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread, till you return to the ground; for out of it were you taken: for dust you are, and to dust shall you return.And Adam called his wife' name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.To Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from from where he was taken.So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.\".lower()"

And to you shall be his desire, and you shall rule over him.And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.And the LORD said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother' keeper?And he said, What have you done? the voice of your brother' blood cries to me from the ground.And now are you cursed from the earth, which has opened her mouth to receive your brother' blood from your hand;When you till the ground, it shall not from now on yield to you her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shall you be in the earth.And Cain said to the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.Behold, you have driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from your face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that finds me shall slay me.And the LORD said to him, Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.

But he seemed as one that mocked to his sons in law.And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take your wife, and your two daughters, which are here; lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.And while he lingered, the men laid hold on his hand, and on the hand of his wife, and on the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful to him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for your life; look not behind you, neither stay you in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest you be consumed.And Lot said to them, Oh, not so, my LORD:Behold now, your servant has found grace in your sight, and you have magnified your mercy, which you have showed to me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:Behold now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.And he said to him, See, I have accepted you concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which you have spoken.Haste you, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till you be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.The sun was risen on the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.Then the LORD rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, see, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelled.And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelled in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelled in a cave, he and his two daughters.And the firstborn said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth:Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said to the younger, Behold, I lay last night with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go you in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.And the first born bore a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites to this day.And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon to this day.\".lower()"

And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, What ails you, Hagar? fear not; for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is.Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in your hand; for I will make him a great nation.And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelled in the wilderness, and became an archer.And he dwelled in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with you in all that you do:Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son' son: but according to the kindness that I have done to you, you shall do to me, and to the land wherein you have sojourned.And Abraham said, I will swear.And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech' servants had violently taken away.And Abimelech said, I know not who has done this thing; neither did you tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.And Abimelech said to Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves?And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shall you take of my hand, that they may be a witness to me, that I have dig this well.Why he called that place Beersheba; because there they swore both of them.Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines'land many days.\".lower()"

And he said, Speak on.And he said, I am Abraham' servant.And the LORD has blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he has given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.And Sarah my master' wife bore a son to my master when she was old: and to him has he given all that he has.And my master made me swear, saying, You shall not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:But you shall go to my father' house, and to my kindred, and take a wife to my son.And I said to my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.And he said to me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way; and you shall take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father' house:Then shall you be clear from this my oath, when you come to my kindred; and if they give not you one, you shall be clear from my oath.And I came this day to the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go:Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin comes forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray you, a little water of your pitcher to drink;And she say to me, Both drink you, and I will also draw for your camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD has appointed out for my master' son.And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down to the well, and drew water: and I said to her, Let me drink, I pray you.And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give your camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter are you? And she said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor' son, whom Milcah bore to him: and I put the earring on her face, and the bracelets on her hands.And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master' brother' daughter to his son.And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceeds from the LORD: we cannot speak to you bad or good.Behold, Rebekah is before you, take her, and go, and let her be your master' son' wife, as the LORD has spoken.And it came to pass, that, when Abraham' servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master.And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.And he said to them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD has prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.And they called Rebekah, and said to her, Will you go with this man? And she said, I will go.And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham' servant, and his men.And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, You are our sister, be you the mother of thousands of millions, and let your seed possess the gate of those which hate them.And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode on the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelled in the south country.And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.For she had said to the servant, What man is this that walks in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a veil, and covered herself.And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah' tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother' death.\".lower()"

And she went to inquire of the LORD.And the LORD said to her, Two nations are in your womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from your bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau' heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was three score years old when she bore them.And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray you, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.And Jacob said, Sell me this day your birthright.And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he swore to him: and he sold his birthright to Jacob.Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.\".lower()"

And Isaac said to him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.And Abimelech said, What is this you have done to us? one of the people might lightly have lien with your wife, and you should have brought guiltiness on us.And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundred times: and the LORD blessed him.And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.For all the wells which his father' servants had dig in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go from us; for you are much mightier than we.And Isaac departed there, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelled there.And Isaac dig again the wells of water, which they had dig in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.And Isaac' servants dig in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.And the herdsmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac' herdsmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.And they dig another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.And he removed from there, and dig another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.And he went up from there to Beersheba.And the LORD appeared to him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham your father: fear not, for I am with you, and will bless you, and multiply your seed for my servant Abraham' sake.And he built an altar there, and called on the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac' servants dig a well.Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.And Isaac said to them, Why come you to me, seeing you hate me, and have sent me away from you?And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with you: and we said, Let there be now an oath between us, even between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you;That you will do us no hurt, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace: you are now the blessed of the LORD.And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.And they rose up betimes in the morning, and swore one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac' servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dig, and said to him, We have found water.And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:Which were a grief of mind to Isaac and to Rebekah.\".lower()"

    "Genesis_27 = \"And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his oldest son, and said to him, My son: and he said to him, Behold, here am I.And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:Now therefore take, I pray you, your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless you before I die.And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless you before the LORD before my death.Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you.Go now to the flock, and fetch me from there two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for your father, such as he loves:And you shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, and that he may bless you before his death.And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse on me, and not a blessing.And his mother said to him, On me be your curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her oldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son:And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck:And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.And he came to his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who are you, my son?And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau your first born; I have done according as you bade me: arise, I pray you, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me.And Isaac said to his son, How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD your God brought it to me.And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray you, that I may feel you, my son, whether you be my very son Esau or not.And Jacob went near to Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob' voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau' hands: so he blessed him.And he said, Are you my very son Esau? And he said, I am.And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son' venison, that my soul may bless you. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD has blessed:Therefore God give you of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:Let people serve you, and nations bow down to you: be lord over your brothers, and let your mother' sons bow down to you: cursed be every one that curses you, and blessed be he that blesses you.And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it to his father, and said to his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son' venison, that your soul may bless me.And Isaac his father said to him, Who are you? And he said, I am your son, your firstborn Esau.And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that has taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? yes, and he shall be blessed.And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.And he said, Your brother came with subtlety, and has taken away your blessing.And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he has supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have you not reserved a blessing for me?And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now to you, my son?And Esau said to his father, Have you but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.And Isaac his father answered and said to him, Behold, your dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;And by your sword shall you live, and shall serve your brother; and it shall come to pass when you shall have the dominion, that you shall break his yoke from off your neck.And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, your brother Esau, as touching you, does comfort himself, purposing to kill you.Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee you to Laban my brother to Haran;And tarry with him a few days, until your brother' fury turn away;Until your brother' anger turn away from you, and he forget that which you have done to him: then I will send, and fetch you from there: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?\".lower()"

And they said, Of Haran are we.And he said to them, Know you Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.And he said to them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter comes with the sheep.And he said, See, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water you the sheep, and go and feed them.And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well' mouth; then we water the sheep.And while he yet spoke with them, Rachel came with her father' sheep; for she kept them.And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother' brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother' brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well' mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother' brother.And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father' brother, and that he was Rebekah' son: and she ran and told her father.And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister' son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.And Laban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh. And he stayed with him the space of a month.And Laban said to Jacob, Because you are my brother, should you therefore serve me for nothing? tell me, what shall your wages be?And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favored.And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.And Laban said, It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had to her.And Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in to her.And Laban gave to his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this you have done to me? did not I serve with you for Rachel? why then have you beguiled me?And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.Fulfill her week, and we will give you this also for the service which you shall serve with me yet seven other years.And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.And he went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD has looked on my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Because the LORD has heard I was hated, he has therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined to me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.And she conceived again, and bore a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.\".lower()"

Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray you, of your son' mandrakes.And she said to her, Is it a small matter that you have taken my husband? and would you take away my son' mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with you to night for your son' mandrakes.And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, You must come in to me; for surely I have hired you with my son' mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.And God listened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob the fifth son.And Leah said, God has given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.And Leah conceived again, and bore Jacob the sixth son.And Leah said, God has endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah.And God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb.And she conceived, and bore a son; and said, God has taken away my reproach:And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son.And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served you, and let me go: for you know my service which I have done you.And Laban said to him, I pray you, if I have found favor in your eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD has blessed me for your sake.And he said, Appoint me your wages, and I will give it.And he said to him, You know how I have served you, and how your cattle was with me.For it was little which you had before I came, and it is now increased to a multitude; and the LORD has blessed you since my coming: and now when shall I provide for my own house also?And he said, What shall I give you? And Jacob said, You shall not give me any thing: if you will do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep your flock.I will pass through all your flock to day, removing from there all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before your face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to your word.And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.And he set three days'journey between himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban' flocks.And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not to Laban' cattle.And it came to pass, whenever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban', and the stronger Jacob'.And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.\".lower()"

    "Genesis_31 = \"And he heard the words of Laban' sons, saying, Jacob has taken away all that was our father'; and of that which was our father' has he gotten all this glory.And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.And the LORD said to Jacob, Return to the land of your fathers, and to your kindred; and I will be with you.And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock,And said to them, I see your father' countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me.And you know that with all my power I have served your father.And your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.If he said thus, The speckled shall be your wages; then all the cattle bore speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be your hire; then bore all the cattle ringstraked.Thus God has taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped on the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.And the angel of God spoke to me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.And he said, Lift up now your eyes, and see, all the rams which leap on the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and spotted: for I have seen all that Laban does to you.I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar, and where you vowed a vow to me: now arise, get you out from this land, and return to the land of your kindred.And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father' house?Are we not counted of him strangers? for he has sold us, and has quite devoured also our money.For all the riches which God has taken from our father, that is ours, and our children': now then, whatever God has said to you, do.Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on camels;And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father'.And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.And he took his brothers with him, and pursued after him seven days'journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said to him, Take heed that you speak not to Jacob either good or bad.Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brothers pitched in the mount of Gilead.And Laban said to Jacob, What have you done, that you have stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?Why did you flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and did not tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?And have not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? you have now done foolishly in so doing.It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, Take you heed that you speak not to Jacob either good or bad.And now, though you would needs be gone, because you sore longed after your father' house, yet why have you stolen my gods?And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure you would take by force your daughters from me.With whomsoever you find your gods, let him not live: before our brothers discern you what is your with me, and take it to you. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.And Laban went into Jacob' tent, and into Leah' tent, and into the two maidservants'tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah' tent, and entered into Rachel' tent.Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel' furniture, and sat on them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before you; for the custom of women is on me. And he searched but found not the images.And Jacob was wroth, and strived with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that you have so hotly pursued after me?Whereas you have searched all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? set it here before my brothers and your brothers, that they may judge between us both.This twenty years have I been with you; your ewes and your she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of your flock have I not eaten.That which was torn of beasts I brought not to you; I bore the loss of it; of my hand did you require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from my eyes.Thus have I been twenty years in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your cattle: and you have changed my wages ten times.Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely you had sent me away now empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.And Laban answered and said to Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children which they have born?Now therefore come you, let us make a covenant, I and you; and let it be for a witness between me and you.And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.And Jacob said to his brothers, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there on the heap.And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and you this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another.If you shall afflict my daughters, or if you shall take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness between me and you.And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast between me and you:This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you shall not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.Then Jacob offered sacrifice on the mount, and called his brothers to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned to his place.\".lower()"

    "Genesis_32 = \"And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God' host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir, the country of Edom.And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall you speak to my lord Esau; Your servant Jacob said thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in your sight.And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother Esau, and also he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him.Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which said to me, Return to your country, and to your kindred, and I will deal well with you:I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which you have showed to your servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.Deliver me, I pray you, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.And you said, I will surely do you good, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,Thirty milk camels with their colts, forty cows, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said to his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space between drove and drove.And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets you, and asks you, saying, Whose are you? and where go you? and whose are these before you?Then you shall say, They be your servant Jacob'; it is a present sent to my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall you speak to Esau, when you find him.And say you moreover, Behold, your servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob' thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.And he said, Let me go, for the day breaks. And he said, I will not let you go, except you bless me.And he said to him, What is your name? And he said, Jacob.And he said, Your name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince have you power with God and with men, and have prevailed.And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray you, your name. And he said, Why is it that you do ask after my name? And he blessed him there.And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose on him, and he halted on his thigh.Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob' thigh in the sinew that shrank.\".lower()"

And he said, The children which God has graciously given your servant.Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.And he said, What mean you by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that you have to yourself.And Jacob said, No, I pray you, if now I have found grace in your sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen your face, as though I had seen the face of God, and you were pleased with me.Take, I pray you, my blessing that is brought to you; because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you.And he said to him, My lord knows that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.Let my lord, I pray you, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goes before me and the children be able to endure, until I come to my lord to Seir.And Esau said, Let me now leave with you some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needs it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem' father, for an hundred pieces of money.And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.\".lower()"

Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father' wives: and Joseph brought to his father their evil report.Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors.And when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brothers: and they hated him yet the more.And he said to them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, see, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.And his brothers said to him, Shall you indeed reign over us? or shall you indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brothers, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.And he told it to his father, and to his brothers: and his father rebuked him, and said to him, What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down ourselves to you to the earth?And his brothers envied him; but his father observed the saying.And his brothers went to feed their father' flock in Shechem.And Israel said to Joseph, Do not your brothers feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send you to them. And he said to him, Here am I.And he said to him, Go, I pray you, see whether it be well with your brothers, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seek you?And he said, I seek my brothers: tell me, I pray you, where they feed their flocks.And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan.And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near to them, they conspired against him to slay him.And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer comes.Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast has devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand on him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.And it came to pass, when Joseph was come to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colors that was on him;And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.And Judah said to his brothers, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be on him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brothers were content.Then there passed by Midianites merchants; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.And Reuben returned to the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.And he returned to his brothers, and said, The child is not; and I, where shall I go?And they took Joseph' coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be your son' coat or no.And he knew it, and said, It is my son' coat; an evil beast has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave to my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.And the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh', and captain of the guard.\".lower()"

And Tamar went and dwelled in her father' house.And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah' wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep shearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold your father in law goes up to Timnath to shear his sheep.And she put her widow' garments off from her, and covered her with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him to wife.When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.And he turned to her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray you, let me come in to you; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What will you give me, that you may come in to me?And he said, I will send you a kid from the flock. And she said, Will you give me a pledge, till you send it?And he said, What pledge shall I give you? And she said, Your signet, and your bracelets, and your staff that is in your hand.

And they said, There was no harlot in this place.And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and you have not found her.And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar your daughter in law has played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by prostitution. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray you, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She has been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound on his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How have you broken forth? this breach be on you: therefore his name was called Pharez.And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread on his hand: and his name was called Zarah.\".lower()"

And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favored.And it came to pass after these things, that his master' wife cast her eyes on Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.But he refused, and said to his master' wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he has committed all that he has to my hand;There is none greater in this house than I; neither has he kept back any thing from me but you, because you are his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he listened not to her, to lie by her, or to be with her.And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,That she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, See, he has brought in an Hebrew to us to mock us; he came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.And she spoke to him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me:And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, After this manner did your servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.And Joseph' master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king' prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph' hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatever they did there, he was the doer of it.The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper.\".lower()"

And Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:And Pharaoh' cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh' cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh' hand.And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up your head, and restore you to your place: and you shall deliver Pharaoh' cup into his hand, after the former manner when you were his butler.But think on me when it shall be well with you, and show kindness, I pray you, to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket on my head.And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up your head from off you, and shall hang you on a tree; and the birds shall eat your flesh from off you.And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh' birthday, that he made a feast to all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.And he restored the chief butler to his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh' hand:But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgot him.\".lower()"

    "Genesis_41 = \"And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favored cows and fat; and they fed in a meadow.And, behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ill favored and skinney; and stood by the other cows on the brink of the river.And the ill favored and skinney cows did eat up the seven well favored and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up on one stalk, rank and good.And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them to Pharaoh.Then spoke the chief butler to Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard' house, both me and the chief baker:And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored to my office, and him he hanged.Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in to Pharaoh.And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of you, that you can understand a dream to interpret it.And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.And Pharaoh said to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood on the bank of the river:And, behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, fat and well favored; and they fed in a meadow:And, behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ill favored and skinney, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:And the lean and the ill favored cows did eat up the first seven fat cows:And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this to the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God has showed Pharaoh what he is about to do.The seven good cows are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.And the seven thin and ill favored cows that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.This is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh: What God is about to do he shows to Pharaoh.Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.And for that the dream was doubled to Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?And Pharaoh said to Joseph, For as much as God has showed you all this, there is none so discreet and wise as you are:You shall be over my house, and according to your word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than you.And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph' hand, and arrayed him in clothing of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without you shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.And Pharaoh called Joseph' name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.And to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bore to him.And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, has made me forget all my toil, and all my father' house.And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; what he said to you, do.And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.\".lower()"

And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.And Joseph knew his brothers, but they knew not him.And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said to them, You are spies; to see the nakedness of the land you are come.And they said to him, No, my lord, but to buy food are your servants come.We are all one man' sons; we are true men, your servants are no spies.And he said to them, No, but to see the nakedness of the land you are come.And they said, Your servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.And Joseph said to them, That is it that I spoke to you, saying, You are spies:Hereby you shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh you shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come here.Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and you shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies.And he put them all together into ward three days.And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:If you be true men, let one of your brothers be bound in the house of your prison: go you, carry corn for the famine of your houses:But bring your youngest brother to me; so shall your words be verified, and you shall not die. And they did so.And they said one to another, We are truly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he sought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come on us.And Reuben answered them, saying, Spoke I not to you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and you would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spoke to them by an interpreter.And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man' money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he to them.And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed there.And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack' mouth.And he said to his brothers, My money is restored; and, see, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God has done to us?And they came to Jacob their father to the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell to them; saying,The man, who is the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.And we said to him, We are true men; we are no spies:We be twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.And the man, the lord of the country, said to us, Hereby shall I know that you are true men; leave one of your brothers here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:And bring your youngest brother to me: then shall I know that you are no spies, but that you are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and you shall traffic in the land.And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man' bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.And Jacob their father said to them, Me have you bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and you will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to you: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to you again.And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which you go, then shall you bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\".lower()"

And he brought Simeon out to them.And the man brought the men into Joseph' house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he yet alive?And they answered, Your servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive.

And he said, God be gracious to you, my son.And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn on his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marveled one at another.And he took and sent messes to them from before him: but Benjamin' mess was five times so much as any of their'.

And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when you do overtake them, say to them, Why have you rewarded evil for good?Is not this it in which my lord drinks, and whereby indeed he divines? you have done evil in so doing.And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words.And they said to him, Why said my lord these words?

And Jacob' heart fainted, for he believed them not.And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.\".lower()"

And he said, Here am I.And he said, I am God, the God of your father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of you a great nation:I will go down with you into Egypt; and I will also surely bring you up again: and Joseph shall put his hand on your eyes.And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:His sons, and his sons'sons with him, his daughters, and his sons'daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob' firstborn.And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.These be the sons of Leah, which she bore to Jacob in Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob, even sixteen souls.The sons of Rachel Jacob' wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bore to him.And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.And the sons of Dan; Hushim.And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and she bore these to Jacob: all the souls were seven.All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob' sons'wives, all the souls were three score and six;And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were three score and ten.And he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to direct his face to Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself to him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.And Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen your face, because you are yet alive.And Joseph said to his brothers, and to his father' house, I will go up, and show Pharaoh, and say to him, My brothers, and my father' house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come to me;And the men are shepherds, for their trade has been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?That you shall say, Your servants'trade has been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.\".lower()"

    "Genesis_47 = \"Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brothers, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.And he took some of his brothers, even five men, and presented them to Pharaoh.And Pharaoh said to his brothers, What is your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Your servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.They said morever to Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for your servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray you, let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Your father and your brothers are come to you:The land of Egypt is before you; in the best of the land make your father and brothers to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if you know any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How old are you?And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.And Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.And Joseph nourished his father, and his brothers, and all his father' household, with bread, according to their families.And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh' house.And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in your presence? for the money fails.And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.And they brought their cattle to Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also has our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:Why shall we die before your eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh'.And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: why they sold not their lands.Then Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: see, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.And it shall come to pass in the increase, that you shall give the fifth part to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.And they said, You have saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh' servants.And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh'.And Israel dwelled in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found grace in your sight, put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray you, in Egypt:But I will lie with my fathers, and you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burial plot. And he said, I will do as you have said.And he said, Swear to me. And he swore to him. And Israel bowed himself on the bed' head.\".lower()"

And he said, Bring them, I pray you, to me, and I will bless them.Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see your face: and, see, God has showed me also your seed.And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel' left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel' right hand, and brought them near to him.And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim' head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh' head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long to this day,The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the middle of the earth.And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father' hand, to remove it from Ephraim' head to Manasseh' head.And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.And he blessed them that day, saying, In you shall Israel bless, saying, God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.\".lower()"

Now therefore let me go up, I pray you, and bury my father, and I will come again.And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury your father, according as he made you swear.And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,And all the house of Joseph, and his brothers, and his father' house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: why the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.And his sons did to him according as he commanded them:For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burial plot of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brothers, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.And when Joseph' brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did to him.And they sent a messenger to Joseph, saying, Your father did command before he died, saying,So shall you say to Joseph, Forgive, I pray you now, the trespass of your brothers, and their sin; for they did to you evil: and now, we pray you, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of your father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.And his brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be your servants.And Joseph said to them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?But as for you, you thought evil against me; but God meant it to good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.Now therefore fear you not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.And Joseph dwelled in Egypt, he, and his father' house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.And Joseph saw Ephraim' children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up on Joseph' knees.And Joseph said to his brothers, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from hence.So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.\".lower()"
